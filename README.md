## Purpose
Collaborators built this app as part of coursework at the UNC Full-Stack program. This project features a landing page that utilizes an engaging Bootstrap carousel that explains and sells the app. The user is then taken to the Fridge page which takes in meal type preference from a dropdown and lets the user confirm what ingredients they have at home. Upon confirmation a query is run and matching recipes are returned. Once the user has selected a recipe that is to their liking, a shopping list will be generated which is the recipe ingredients less what the person has at home in the fridge!

## Technologies
Javascript, HTML, CSS, FlexBox, Bootstrap, Handlebars, MySQL, Require, Sequilize, Heroku, and Express.
